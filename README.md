## What it does

To overcome the problem of lack of knowledge and resources we have created a platform connecting the local NGOs and government where you can ask for basic health care facilities like blood donation, medicines, and oxygen cylinders.
But that's not the only problem faced, the major problem is that people don't have the right amount of knowledge which is provided to us. We provide them with the right information regarding the most important like sex education, menstruation problems, hygiene, mental health, etc. through podcasts and blogs by doctors and activists. We also provide disease prediction and you can directly ask for help from NGOs and doctors for that disease.
