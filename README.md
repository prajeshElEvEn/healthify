## What it does

Not having basic healthcare Ed. is a widespread problem in society yet no one cares about it. This can lead to serious health problems later.
Lack of facilities and awareness are the major cause of this problem. People donâ€™t know what the symptoms signify, and find it hard to consult with someone.
It has become the primary concern of this decade which needs to be controlled. Mental health is one of the that got worse if we don't have proper knowledge about it. Poor mental health or any health-related problem can affect the economy not just directly but also if you look at the opportunity cost and terms of the long-term cost of it.
